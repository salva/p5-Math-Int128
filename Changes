Revision history for Perl extension Math::Int128.

{{$NEXT}}

0.22     2015-04-07
      - Fix for #RT103359: CLONE hook was dying because its signature
        was wrong (bug report by Duke Smith)

0.21     2015-03-09
      - Remove obsolete compiler checks from C API files (bug report
        and analysis by Matt Sisk)
      - Fix compilation in Solaris with Solaris Studio
      - Add test for Strawberry Perl bug

0.20     2015-02-10
      - Fix syntax error masked by some isspace macro implementations.

0.19     2015-02-08
      - Fix bug #101982: infinite loop in string_to_uint128 (reported
        by Matt Sisk).

0.18     2015-01-05
      - No changes from last release.

0.17_02  2014-12-30
      - Reverted the probe change in the last version. This wasn't necessary
        and it brought back the old failure of clang on FreeBSD i386 claiming
        it supported int128 values when it really didn't.

0.17_01  2014-12-29
      - Trying out a slightly different probe for uint128 support. The
        previous version could have (very rarely) returned false when it
        should have returned true.
      - Made this module compile with the system Perl on OSX by brutally
        stripping the "-arch i386" flag when running the compiler. Your
        results may vary (but it passes its tests).

0.17     2014-12-23
      - No changes from the last release.

0.16_05  2014-12-18
      - More left and right shift fixes. When shifting left by more than 127
        bits, the return value is always 0. When shifting right by more than
        127 bits, the return value is 0 for numbers >= 0 and -1
        otherwise. This is consistent with how Math::Int64 works.

0.16_04  2014-12-15
      - clang on FreeBSD i386 will claim to support 128-bit integers but then
        segfault when compiling this module's XS code. The compiler feature
        checking now uses a more complex test program to ensure that the
        compiler really does support 128-bit integers.

0.16_03  2014-12-13
      - Removed compiler detection in favor of compiler feature checking with
        Config::AutoConf. (Dave Rolsky)

        report by Dave Rolsky)

      - include stdint.h for 64bit integer definitions (bug report and
        solution by Sisyphus)
